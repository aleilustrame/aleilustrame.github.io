                <p>1. GENERAL</p>
                <br>
                <p>1.1 If the client wants something specific (Expression // background // pose // etc.), it must be specified in the commission request.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the final result of the drawing is missing something that the client wanted it to have, but it was not indicated when placing the order, a refund will not be made.</li>
                        <li>Making changes to the drawing once finished (for reasons unrelated to an error made by the illustrator Jhonny Ramirez), will only be possible with an extra payment.</li>
                        <li>Errors made by Jhonny Ramirez will be corrected free of charge, regardless of when they were made.</li>
                        <li>Commissions are made in the order in which they were paid.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>2. PAYMENT</p>
                <br>
                <p>2.1 The accepted payment methods are PayPal, Western Union, Nequi and Bancolombia</p>
                <p>2.2 Payment of 50% of the total agreed commission value will be made once the commission has been accepted</p>
                <p>2.3 Once the sketch is shown and it is accepted by the client, the client must make the payment of the missing value of the agreed commission</p>
                <p>2.4 For more characters in the same commission, an additional 70% per character must be paid (depending on 
                    the technique chosen by the client and the size of the character).</p>
                <p>2.5 The base prices are per character with a simple background at the client's request, for a more complex background it must 
                    be specified in the request and the value will be 
                    agreed depending on the complexity of the background to be made.</p>
                <br>
                <p>3. USE</p>
                <br>
                <p>3.1 Jhonny Ramirez retains the rights to each image produced. Payment is for the creation of a custom work, not for transfer of rights.</p>
                <p>3.2 The final work may be published by Jhonny Ramirez on any of his social networks or pages (always indicating that said drawing 
                    is a commission), unless otherwise specified.</p>
                <p>3.3 Drawings may be published on other websites by the commissioner if credit is given.</p>    
                <p>3.4 Any commission made by Flasho is for personal or non-profit use only, unless otherwise discussed. The client should not take advantage of the
                     work done without discussing it in advance and thus reaching an agreement.</p>
                <p>3.5 Commercial Use Commissions do not transfer authorship of the work.</p>
